Endpoints will require:

Full CRUD on coffee and full CRUD on users. Only admins get full CRUD on users, and that should be reflected in the UI when dashboard is rendered.

Coffee GET endpoints should include /getall/:user_id, but also "see other coffees" which is /getall that gets EVERYONE's coffee inputs. Only user_id ones should have "edit" button next to them. Admin gets "edit" button to ALL.

Let's also implement a search which will allow user to search for a specific coffee. The results should be dynamic and change as the user types (which should be an easy implementation as React is a SPA which trigger re-render each time a hook value changes OR based on useEffect). Read up on useEffect dependency useEffect(() => {}, [] if it's evading your mind currently.

This will also need a CDN (content delivery network) to upload the image of the coffee bag and only send the link generated by the CDN into the db.

Please utilize MaterialUI to style and AWS EC2 instance to deploy.


    When a user logs in, they are redirected to the /dashboard route, where their coffees are displayed in a grid using CoffeeCard components. Each CoffeeCard includes an "Edit" button if the user owns the coffee or if the user is an admin.
    An "Add Coffee" button in the Dashboard component triggers the AddCoffeeModal.
    A search bar is placed above the grid of CoffeeCard components. As the user types in the SearchBar component, the coffee grid updates dynamically based on the search query.
    If the user is an admin, they can access the /admin/users route to manage users (UserManagement component).
    The CDN integration allows users to upload coffee bag images, and the generated link is stored in the database.
